# Fragments
Fragments allow users to add new rules, monitors, discoveries, etc. to management packs, quickly and accurately.

Kevin Holman of Microsoft has written a series of blog articles about using fragments with VSAE (Visual Studio Authoring Extensions).
See the following article to get started.

Silect has added fragments support to MP Author Professional and MP Studio. They now allow you to select a fragment, replace the parameters
(including browsing for many values), and merging the new elements created by the fragment into a management pack.

Kevin followed up with an article on using fragments with MP Author Professional, including a webcast demonstration.

New for version 8.0, you can now select an existing element in any management pack and turn that into a fragment. This allows you to create
many new elements similar to the one you started with. If you chose to not add any parameter, this can also be used to copy and paste elements
from an existing management pack into a new management pack.
